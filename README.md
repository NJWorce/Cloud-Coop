# Cloud-Coop
This is an online grade-keeping application for the homeschool community.
My goal is to replace current software used to track grades for homeschool students enrolled in homeschool teaching centers and cooperative teaching organizations, or co-ops. There is a need for a replacement student-grade tracking application in the homeschool community because current industry standard software is either becoming unavailable or the price range is not within reason for many homeschool organizations.

This is a django application with a bootstrap front-end and a PostSQL database. My desire is to implement this application in a modular manner in order to later refactor code to be in line with contemporary application layering practices.

Scalability and security are in mind here, thus the use of the Django framework and SSL certificate for HTTPS encryption.
This Software has no current licence.
